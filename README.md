Discord Theme v1.0


How to add a theme 

To add a theme/style you can either, edit the css for a few lines of css code or for much bigger themes you can add the THEME.css to C:\Users\NAME\AppData\Roaming\BetterDiscord\themes in Windows, ~/Library/Preferences/BetterDiscord/themes in OSX, or where ever the BetterDiscord folder is located, fully close down discord, reopen and click the theme you want in the settings.
